# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written in Python.

## About

This repository contains my attempts at solving the daily programming puzzles from Advent of Code 2025. Each day presents two challenges that get progressively more difficult as December goes on. All solutions are implemented in Python.

## Structure

## Note

🤞 Keep your fingers crossed for me to stay persistent through all 12 days!
